## StockOps

An investment app where an investor can invest in equities as well as commodities. A company founder can create a new company, get a lisence for running a business and get its company listed in the stock market. A company can also act as an investor in itself by holding stakes in other companies. The company will hire an investment manager to do the investing on their behalf. New brokers can sign up on this portal, get assigned a market and help investors complete transactions. Brokers can be for both equity as well as commodity. The fluctuations in the market prices for equities is controlled by the securities and exchange board whereas the fluctuations in the commodity prices is moderated by the commodities and futures trading commission. Each investor will be able to track their holdins using this app, and also be able to track their profits and losses. At the end of the day, a market analyst generates a report for the market as well as for individual equities.
